## Hi there 👋

🚀 About Me

I am Rutuja Yashwant Pise, a Computer Science and Engineering graduate from Yashoda Technical Campus, Satara. Passionate about web development , I aspire to create impactful digital solutions that simplify technology for everyday users.

👩‍💻 Currently, I am pursuing an internship at ScaleFull Technologies, where I focus on front-end development and React applications. Alongside, I am exploring Explainable AI (XAI) and working on an Automated Loan Approval System project to gain deeper insights into AI-driven decision-making.

🌐 I enjoy building interactive, user-friendly websites and have worked on projects involving CSS Grid layouts, responsive dashboards, ecommerce systems with cart functionality, blog platforms with routing & localStorage, and modern UI components using React.

📖 A strong believer in continuous learning, I regularly follow tech magazines, explore new frameworks, and work on hands-on projects to strengthen my technical, creative, and problem-solving skills.

🚀 Looking ahead, I am eager to pursue opportunities that allow me to grow further while contributing meaningfully, with a long-term vision of joining companies that focus on building simplified, high-tech, and impactful web applications.

💡 Beyond academics, I am curious, motivated, and driven by the idea of making a positive social impact through technology.
