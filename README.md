## Hi there 👋

🚀 About Me

I am Rutuja Yashwant Pise, currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Yashoda Technical Campus, Satara. Passionate about web development and cloud computing, I aspire to create impactful digital solutions that simplify technology for everyday users.

👩‍💻 My interests span across front-end development, React applications, and cloud platforms like AWS, Google App Engine, and Microsoft Azure. I am also exploring areas like Explainable AI (XAI), where I am working on an Automated Loan Approval System project.

🌐 I enjoy building interactive, user-friendly websites and have worked on projects involving CSS Grid layouts, responsive dashboards, ecommerce systems with cart functionality, blog websites with routing & localStorage, and attractive UI components with React.

📖 A firm believer in continuous learning, I actively follow tech magazines, explore new frameworks, and work on assignments/projects that strengthen both my technical and problem-solving skills.

🚀 I am looking forward to internship opportunities that allow me to grow further while contributing meaningfully, with a long-term vision of joining companies that focus on creating simplified, high-tech websites and applications.

💡 Beyond academics, I am curious, motivated, and driven by the idea of making a social impact through technology.
